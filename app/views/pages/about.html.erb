            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>I was born in Belgrade, Serbia, former Yugoslavia. I was lucky enough to have great parents: a tough father who would push me to be the best in anything I do, no matter what, and a gentle mother who would support me what ever I wanted to do.</p>
            <p>My dad was electrical and mechanical engineer, and because I was the older son, I had to go everywhere to help him. I think that is the time when I discovered my passion for computers. I was so clumsy with anything my dad wanted me to do (things like disassembling huge water pumps that are 70lbs+ heavy, getting the right tools to him; you know, the things that all 12 year old kids do). I imagined myself slipping on a flat ground while carrying sharp tools, and I just had to pass that great opportunity. I picked the safe place to be - behind the screen, sitting in a comfy chair.</p>
            <h4>Early Days</h4>
            <p>Having parents like I had was a blessing for me, and when you add a super-awesome uncle to the mix - that was like adding a cherry on top of the cake for me.</p>
            <p>My uncle is a super-smart guy, probably the smartest person I know. When I was a little kid, he always took me with him where ever he was going. I didn't quite understand what his job was at the time, but I know that he had that big grey box under his desk, a screen with green words on a black background and a box with some letters on it. He was doing something to it, it made noise, and I was like whoa! I wanted to be my uncle right there and than.</p>
            <h4>Fast Forward 20 Years...</h4>
            <p>I'm 32 now, and I did a ton of stuff in the meantime.</p>
            <p>I finished highschool, I graduated, started a business - failed, started another business - kinda had a success, got a job, lost a job, had some epic parties and finally - moved to Canada.</p>
            <h4>Early Canadian Days</h4>
            <p>I landed in Montreal, on my birthday, and that was the happiest day of my life. I felt so alive, so grateful to be where I was! Nothing was more important to me but that moment! I landed at 1am, had no change for a pay phone, had no idea where I was, I kinda knew French but soon I realized that I didn't know French. All I had was this phone number of my landlord, who I never met nor spoke with before, and address where my apartment is. I lived in apartment that is smaller than your bathroom. Closet actually had a bed that you pull from the top, and than my room would be just that - a big bed. Nothing else could fit in there. Happy days. </p>
            <p>I moved to Vancouver right after the first winter came, which was about a month later. It went from +5 degrees to -30 overnight, and I felt I can't handle the cold, so I decided to move. Fortunately for me, my super-badass-cool uncle lives in Vancouver, so I stayed with my family for some time.</p>
            <h4>Fast Forward 4 Years...</h4>
            <p>I had a chance to work with my uncle, at the same company for over 4 years now. I enjoyed every second of it. Remember, he was my hero growing up.</p>
            <p>I started my own business in June 2012. I wanted to sell my web skills to the good people of Vancouver. I was a bit chubby guy back in the days, and I just loved cookies, so I decided to call my company Cookie. But, not just any cookie, I called it "The Cookie".</p>
            <p>It was an emotional roller coaster, as any business is. But, I learnt a lot of things which was more valuable than money I made.</p>
            <p>I learnt that you have to stay hungry, you have to invest time in your education when ever you can, and you have to stay focused. And that's what I do today.</p>
